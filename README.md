# LingoForge

Fun, Duolingo-style web app for learning **Russian** and **Spanish** from English. Local-first PWA — no backend, no accounts, no cost. Progress lives in your browser (per-profile export/import included).

## Why it works (the methodology)

- **Cyrillic first** — 33 letters in 4 similarity groups (identical → false friends → new shapes → unique sounds), with mnemonics and audio drills. Russian is phonetic: read = pronounce.
- **Frequency-first vocabulary** — top words inside reusable **sentence patterns** (*Я хочу ___*, *¿Dónde está ___?*), never naked flashcards. Words are stored with their inflected forms.
- **Spaced repetition (SRS)** — every word gets FSRS-style scheduling; the Practice tab resurfaces words right before you forget them.
- **Daily loop** — review first, then one new 3–5 minute lesson. Honest active-minutes tracking (pauses when idle), daily goal ring, streaks, XP with combo multipliers, badges.

## Features

- 7 exercise types: multiple choice, word bank, listening (browser TTS), typing with tolerant checking (ё/е, Spanish accents), matching pairs, Cyrillic drills, pattern substitution
- Multiple local profiles (Netflix-style picker), each with its own courses and progress
- Stats: weekly minutes chart, 4-week streak heatmap, badges, JSON backup
- Installable PWA, mobile-first, claymorphism design, reduced-motion support

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm test         # engine + content integrity tests
npm run build    # production build (dist/)
```

Audio uses the Web Speech API — Edge/Chrome on desktop include ru-RU and es-ES voices.

## Adding content

Courses are typed data in `src/content/courses/*.ts` (validated by `src/content/content.test.ts`). Add vocab/lessons/units there — no app code changes needed.
